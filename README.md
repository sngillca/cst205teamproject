REQUIREMENTS: 

You will need to "pip install flickrapi" for this to work.
Here are all the other imports you will need:
import sys, string
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QLabel, QPushButton, QLineEdit, QHBoxLayout, QVBoxLayout, QComboBox
from PyQt5.QtCore import pyqtSlot
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPixmap
from PIL import Image, ImageQt, ImageDraw, ImageFont,  ImageQt
from random import*
import flickrapi
import urllib
import random

The program accesses the Flickr API, then presents the user
with a GUI with which the user can mess around with. There
are multiple options for the user to use; search for a 
background image -if they don't the default image is set
to a dog, choose a filter for meme lines -such as "love",
"finals", "work", just to name a few. Or the user can 
input their own lines.
